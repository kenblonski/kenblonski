## Welcome to my GitHub Pages

I'm usuing the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/kenblonski/kenblonski/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview this content in Markdown files.

GitHub Pages is running [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to (re)build the pages in this site from content in my markdown files. For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

I am currently using the Tactile theme (layout and style) provided in Jekyll.
